First Street, like the Lanier Mansion, was designed by Francis Costigan in the Greek Revival style. This two and a half story home displays the same mastery of proportions Costigan employs in the nearby Lanier home, but is more restrained in ornamentation. Built from 1846-49, the cubic home sits on a foundation of dressed sandstone with multipane windows at the basement level. The walls are of a hand-polished pink brick laid in a common bond variant pattern. Pilasters at the corners have egg-and-dart and beadwork ornamentation. Both the north and south facade features a twelve-foot solid panel door. The door on the north side First Street entrance is deeply recessed with sidelights and a classical door surround. The south river view entrance also has sidelights, but is flush with the walls and beneath a Classic style portico. This porch has two fluted columns with bud-style capitals and a cornice with dentils. The windows of the home are either six/over/nine or six/over/six. Those on the first floor are thirteen foot in height and all have pedimented stone lintels with acroterian detail. There are iron balconnettes on south facade windows. This home, like the Lanier home, has an encircling wide entablature that rises to conceal the roof. The Shrewsbury entablature has dentils, beadwork, and rectangular attic windows. A one-story service wing adjoins the west side of the house. It has a hipped roof, windows similar to the main house, and its own entrance. The home's interior features Costigan's famous freestanding spiral staircase and a majestic drawing room. Designated a National Historic Landmark"

Lanier House at 511 W. First Street is a superb example of Greek Revival architecture.  The Lanier Home opened as a museum in 1926 as Indiana's first historical memorial. Architect Francis Costigan designed and built this house in 1843 for Madison financier James Lanier. The home has outstanding beauty and proportions, demonstrates successful adaptation of period architectural pattern books, and retains a high degree of integrity in preservation. The three-story mansion is cubic in form and sits upon a high foundation of coursed, square-cut dressed sandstone. Walls are of brick common bond, each side has three bays of windows separated by pilasters. The home presents a porch facade to both its northern First Street side and its southern Ohio River side. The north facade has a one-story flat roof portico with classic columns. The entry on this side is an inset full panel door with side transom lights and a classic surround. The southern facade has a grand full height and width porch. Simple Corinthian capitals top the four fluted columns that stretch two and a half stories tall. The ceiling of this porch features delicate beadwork and molded decoration. The entry doors on this southern side are similar to those on the north facade. Windows on north and south facades are six/over/nine on the ground floor; windows on the second floor and the sides are six/over/six panes. Windows on each facade directly above the central door are wider, divided into three sections by a column. All windows have wide Classic pediment surrounds with decorative rosettes. The roof of the home is not visible from the ground, as a tall fascia board rises to hide it. This board is decorated with Anthernion carvings at the center of each side, dentils, various molding details, and has round windows encircled by wreaths. A central cupola rises above the central stairwell to crown the building. There is a one-story kitchen addition to the east side with a mansard roof and pedimented windows. The interior features a cantilevered spiral staircase, double parlors, and unusual window shutters. The site also includes many iron fences, the gardens (described separately,) archeological excavation sites, and statuary. Designated a National Historic Landmark"

It was planted ca. 1875 by Alexander Lanier and has been partially restored based on a historic lithograph and other investigations. Much of the fruits and vegetables which were also grown at this site were planted in an adjacent greenhouse which has not survived. In addition to the garden and the greenhouse, the property once included dog kennels and a small pasture. The latter is still represented at the back of the lot.  The restored formal garden is an excellent example of a designed garden in an estate property."

The one and a half story building takes an octagonal form on a stone foundation. The walls are composed of sandstone and buff, glazed brick. The full verandah porch with turned posts and scroll cut brackets takes the same roofline as the building. The main entry is a set of double carved panel doors with ovate upper lights and upper transom lights. There are clerestory windows on the second level above the octagonal waiting room; these have multi-panes of stained glass. Windows on the baggage room extension have double arches of brick for their lintels. The roof follows the octagon shape and terminates in a tower with a finial top. The eaves are overhanging with expressed rafters. Brick paving surrounds the station. The Jefferson County Historic Society, located next door, operates the building as a museum."

Much like the rectory, an urban forest grows at the rear of the church. Construction of the three-story church began in 1837 as a rectangular plan with a coursed cut stone foundation and walls also clad in coursed cut stone. A stone stoop leads to the front of the Gothic Revival church. Openings exist as a large entry with a pointed arch, stained glass upper transom light and double leaf entry door. Composite colored windows have pressed metal hoods, stone sills and pointed arches.  St. Michael's Church is topped by a high pitch front gable roof. A sculpted stone archangel decorates the gable and a large cross stands atop the front gable. The five-story bell tower comes to a point at the rear with a cross finial.

It was dedicated to this purpose even before the addition in which it is located was platted. Later Springdale Cemetery to the north replaced this site as the city burying ground. There is a curvilinear walk along the upper part of the park with large trees, benches, a gazebo and other small scale features. The lower level is devoted primarily to sports, with a large playing field. The latter was made possible after Crooked Creek was relocated to the north during the nineteenth century. During the Victorian era, after the burials had been removed, a series of structures were built, including a round folly with a segmented, slightly bellcast, roof covered in slate shingles and sporting metal ridgeline caps and a decorative ball at  the spire (Photo No. 25). This small contributing building was constructed of a combination of petrified rock and rough cut local limestone.  A more spectacular feature was also built in the park - a round fountain of petrified rock, with a buttressed three foot base and a conical upper structure, of the same material. Today, only the base of this fountain remains in the park, but one can see the distinctive rocks used in several walls in other parts of the town, perhaps removed from the park when the fountain was dismantled. The vegetation includes several large trees, including a 48"" caliper sycamore and others. The natural bowl formed by the topography is utilized now as in history as a viewing area for the sports activities."

Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Boston pioneered the movement early in the century and many others followed. Springdale is set in a small protected valley at the north side of Madison, with Crooked Creek as its southern boundary, and the base of the hill as its northern boundary. Today, State highway 7 has cut off the original entry, although the land and burials have remained intact. Entrance to the cemetery is now from the east and visitors travel down the main road from east to west, with secondary roads branching off in a rectilinear pattern.  The grounds are punctuated by several stone lined drainage ditches running in a north/south direction, probably dating from the middle of the nineteenth century. Sections of the cemetery are highlighted by tall sculpture and decorative markers, including a number of obelisks and other styles. Several family plots are located, European style, in terraces up the hill - some with rock faced stone retaining walls. There is a spectacular sculpture, ""Let there be Light'', by the nationally known artist George Grey Barnard. Only a few buildings are included on the site. One, a gable front residence serves as an office and was probably incorporated into the cemetery during a period of expansion.  A second building is a Gothic Revival chapel constructed in 1916 and designed by the architect Frederick Wallick who designed a large number of important houses in Indianapolis, including ""Oldfields"" (for the Lilly family), ""Lanesend"" for Nicholas H. Noyes and ""Westerley"", the G. H. A. Clowes house, as well as the Polk Hotel, in Polk County, Florida, and the Joseph J. Cole house in Indianapolis.   The latter two are both listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Wallick's chapel in Springdale is constructed of dressed stone with imitation quoins, corner buttresses, stained glass windows and a gable front roof with crockets, and a raised parapet with dressed coping. One object, one building and the landscape (site) are contained within this property. The building at 600 Fifth Street is also within the cemetery. However, it has been listed individually. Springdale Cemetery is shown on maps 2, 3 and 4."

The three-story school was built in a rectangular plan with a concrete, limestone water table foundation and brick clad walls. Rounded concrete steps lead toward the East Street entrance made of modern glass doors with limestone and brick neoclassic surround.  Large windows cover the building with louvered openings and brick and limestone radiating brick voussoirs, and decorative ten bay facade.

This home sits upon a three-foot bluff of land and was likely constructed around the turn of the century. Its walls and foundation are cast concrete block: that and the irregular plan are typical of the period. Beneath its flat roof porch with Tuscan columns is the upper light panel door with composite decorative pane windows. The front of the home features a bay projection with one/over/one pane windows. The roof of the home is a very high pitch hip-on-gable. Each gable end features varied decorative shingles, decorative bargeboards, and diamond pane windows, some with lintels and sills. There is a central brick chimney. A rough cut coursed stone retaining wall that has a wood arched door leading to the basement level of the home encircles the yard."

It is one of four buildings located on the Bierck-Heuse Block. Others are 223, 225 and 229 E Main Street.  Even though previous records state construction dates in the 1880s, there is interior  evidence that at least the building at number 227 was built in the 1830s. For example, the building seems to have been shorter, but  added on to at a later date. Not only that, the outline of the former roof on 227 can be seen from the third floor of 225. It was originally a low pitch side gable, which suggests an older date. In each, the first floor was originally one long narrow room used for retail business. The other buildings also appear to date earlier than the front facades. These buildings were remodeled ca. 1880 for Peter Bierck and Otto Reuse as a continuous block of four storefronts.  All four buildings were unified with new Italianate windows, facades, cornices and ground floor iron fronts.  The store front of 227 E. Main St. is iron, in excellent condition, with Corinthian columns. The upper light door has a blocked upper transom and sidelights.  Windows are two/over/two lights with pressed metal hoods. The building is topped by a shed roof with projecting cornice, decorative eaves, brackets and panel.  It  has a rectangular plan with walls clad in brick laid in a common bond"

Main Street is another of Madison's Federal style commercial buildings with Italianate detailing added in the latter 19th century. The brick common bond walls create a side gable profile on the Central Avenue side of the building. The first floor entry of this building has been greatly modified but retains cast iron columns. The fenestration on the second and third floors retains a great deal of integrity. The smaller scale of the two/over/two light windows indicate an early nineteenth century origin, and the later additions of pressed metal projecting hoods belie the Italianate additions. The facade features a wide projecting Italianate cornice decorated with brackets and panels."

Located at 106 Milton Street, the main building shares its lot with four outbuildings for manufacturing, including the assembly shop, blacksmith shop, woodworking shop and sawmill/engine room. Two buildings are lined up on the east side behind the former Schroeder home, with the larger shop opposite, in a grid. Modern wire fencing marks the eastern boundary while a deep stone drainage lies on the west. A linear lane runs from the beginning of the site to the rear, past two large sycamore trees in the front yard and small plants against a side hill.  The Saddletree Factory main building (the former home) is one and  a half stories with outer walls clad in brick common bond.  The form of the building is a I-plan with a brick foundation.  A porch sets along the rear, but only on the rear wing. The roof is a medium gable with pierced work in front and side gable ends with decorative fascia. Windows are four/over/over on the front of the building with more windows and segmental arch openings on the side. The main door has a segmental arch upper light and losenge transom, along with dressed stone heads and sills."

This group of buildings may have been constructed as early as 1819 and includes a business that has been in operation under the name Central Hotel since at least 1886. Most of the buildings are three stories in height and retain their original facades. All are constructed of brick laid in a variant of the Flemish bond pattern. The building at 301, the Central Hotel, has a mitered corner opening with commercial glass windows. Above, its windows are replacements set in openings with Italianate segmental arch pressed metal hoods and stone sills. The building at No. 303 has similar modern windows set in flat pedimented Italianate crowns. Along the Second Street side of the Central Hotel, the windows are modern twelve/over/nine pane set in the original flat dressed stone lintel and sills. The side gabled rooflines of 301 and 303 are joined with an Italianate projecting front cornice that has decorative floral elements and scroll  cut brackets, this cornice continues around the side of 301. The building at 305 Mulberry lacks Italianate updates and is more purely Federal. Though its street opening is modern, the windows above are nine/over/nine with wooden lintels and sills. Its roofline, like that at 307 and 309 to the north, is a simple band of brick corbelling and dentils at the cornice. No. 307 has openings with flat dressed stone lintels and sills and a modern street level door. The building at 309, however, features a cast iron front from a later nineteenth-century Italianate upgrade. This front has Corinthian columns flanking double upper light commercial glass doors. The windows above are six/over/six and four/over/four with dressed stone lintels and sills. The building at 311 has lost much of its original integrity in windows and doors, but retains the original openings on the second and third floors and remnants of an iron front. Its roofline has a projecting cornice with brackets. No. 313 is similar to other houses in the row, it has replacement windows in flat dressed stone lintels and sills and a simple cornice with brick corbelling and dentils. The two-story building at the end of the row has an iron front with scrolled top pilasters. These pilasters divide modern window and panel fill. The upper floors have replacement windows with the same  flat dressed stone lintels and sills. The alley side of this building features windows with segmental arch openings. In total, this grouping  of building well retains the scope and character of early Federal style commercial row architecture ."

Russell West and Mathew Temperly built the Christ Episcopal Church at 506 Mulberry Street in the Gothic Revival style. The church derives its character from the pointed arch doors and windows. The vertical panel entry door is set into a pointed arch brick surround with flanking buttresses. The windows along the nave are stained glass and set into pointed arch openings with stone sills and brick surrounds. A buttress is found between each of the windows along the side walls. The high pitch roof is also typical of the style,  and this one features a tower at the southwest corner with a conical roof and pointed arch vents and dormer windows. The tower also has a circular window and a cross at its finial. The foundation of the church is of coursed, dressed stone and the walls are laid in brick common bond pattern. Notable as well in this building are the stained glass windows on the rear, ca. 1850, which were painted and then fired in a rare process. The congregation ordered these from German artisans in Cincinnati. The architect designed the iron fence in the yard."

The style of this four-story  building is 19th century functional, with a coursed cut stone foundation, a rectangular plan and walls clad in brick common bond. This mill, that produced cotton twine and yardages, sits on ground that slopes slightly toward the south and faces the Ohio River.  A gravel drive into a yard, enclosed by a chain link fence, is accessible by Vaughn Drive. The complex is so huge that it occupies an entire block. There are no actual porches, but various wood overhangs are present. Three layers of brick segmental arch openings are visible above 30 pane casement windows with stone sills, 25 bays and panel upper light doors with upper transom lights. The roof is nearly flat and made of metal with overhanging eaves. Various industrial related shops and sheds lie to the north, along with one large metal clad modern building. The Eagle Cotton Mill is the most extensive and complete surviving example of industrial architecture built during the 19th century when Madison was a prospering waterfront. There was a ca. 1950 shed roof garage which has now been demolished."

This inn was constructed in the 1820s largely to accommodate travelers on the nearby Ohio River. The 3-story rectangular building abuts the sidewalk on Walnut Street and an alleyway to the south. While its high foundation is parged, brick walls above reveal a Flemish bond pattern. Windows are replacement six/over/six and nine/over/six double hung windows set into the original openings with radiating brick voussoirs, as lintels and limestone sills. Windows at the basement level have wood lintels. There are two double doors at the first level, likely leading out to where there originally was a porch. Today there are iron balconettes. The roof is hipped on the south side and of standing seam metal. There is a gable end chimney."

The two story Italianate building has an unusual facade of varied arched elements. It was likely constructed around 1850 and received Italianate updates in the latter part of that century. The rectangular building's foundation is of sandstone and rubble stone supporting walls of brick in the common bond pattern. The facade has three bays of arched openings. The right and left openings have upper light doors with fanlight transoms above. The central, wider opening has an unusual five/over/one commercial pane glass window. Above these three arches are three arched openings with two/over/two light windows. All have flat stone sills. Side openings are four/over/four pane segmental arch openings. The front gable standing seam metal roof has a central arched vertical projection on the front facade. Within this arched area is a circular window. Italianate brackets support the overhanging eaves and wide gutters that surround the building."

The first was washed out by a flood. The present structure is of dressed, rock-faced stone, with a round arched opening framed by stone voussoirs. A stone ledge was built to allow workers to pass through the bridge. While the entrados was all of stone, the extrados and the railroad road bed was of compacted soil (at one time ballast was placed atop to accommodate the track.  Interestingly enough, the creek bed as it passed under the approximately 40 foot bridge was also lined in dressed, coursed stone, probably to prevent the creek from eroding the foundations of the bridge."
Stone Curbs and Gutters  ,Stone Curbs and Gutters,Culvert,,Functional,19th Century,Other: 19th C. Functional,TRUE,FALSE,1880,1880,C,1,,,,,,,,,,"Many of the stone curbs and gutters in Madison have survived from as early as ca. 1850. They can be found on the north-south streets, especially in the oldest parts of the historic district. A typical example of a full stone gutter can be seen on Elm Street adjacent to the Lanier Mansion.  Hard limestone, or calcite, rough dressed, is laid on end to form the edge curbs, while slabs of the same stone are buried, perpendicular to the edge curbs, to form the center of the guttering. Other types, which may date later, utilize large, dressed stone as curbs only. Although they exist at many locations around town and with some variety, the stone curbs and gutters of Madison have been counted as one resource (structure)."
