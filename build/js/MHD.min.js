The building is two and a half stories high, with an irregular industrial form. The walls are laid in brick common bond. Notable about this building is its multitude of windows. These are mostly six/over/six windows with wood sills and brick corbelled crowns. The south facade features a row of eight paired six/over/six windows in segmental arch openings, allowing a great deal of light into the factory space's open plan. Doors throughout are modern metal.

Even though the foundation is not visible, the plan is rectangular with walls clad in brick common bond. Including the large attic floor created by the mansard roof, the building contains four stories, with inset entries on the ground floor. The front of the  building is ornamented with Corinthian columns and a segmental arch above the center entry. Large glass display windows are prominent with prism glass above. Windows are two over two lights with segmental arches. The Mansard roof on the Masonic Building has two slopes on all four sides, but the lower slope is much steeper. The roof is topped by standard slate shingles, interrupted by portions of multi-colored slate in a diamond pattern. Arched dormer windows are above a cornice of scrolled eave brackets, while at the center of the facade a gable rises with a half star crown. Much like other Second Empire buildings, the Masonic Building is completely symmetrical. Recorders of the Historic American Buildings Survey remarked: "Of special note on the facade of the building are the stone ball and water-leaf capitals of the small collumnettes that set off the storefronts of the first floor, which are beautiful examples of the talents of local stone cutters."',streetGeo:{latitude:38.7362676,longitude:-85.37794969999999}},{Address:"217 Lincoln Avenue","Historic Name of Resource":"","Building Type":"House","Freestanding or Other":"",Style:"Vernacular: Shotgun",SubStyle:"None","Primary Style":"Other: Shotgun",Approximate:"TRUE",Range:"FALSE",StartDate:1840,EndDate:1840,"NHL Rating":"C","#C":1,"#N/C":null,"N/C Reason":"",latitude:38.740367,longitude:-85.388425,"Street Number":"217",Modifier:"","Street Direction":"",Street:"Lincoln","Street Type":"Avenue",Notes:"",streetGeo:{latitude:38.7403272,longitude:-85.38823459999998}},{Address:"217 Walnut Street","Historic Name of Resource":"","Building Type":"House","Freestanding or Other":"",Style:"Federal",SubStyle:"None","Primary Style":"Federal",Approximate:"TRUE",Range:"FALSE",StartDate:1850,EndDate:1850,"NHL Rating":"C","#C":1,"#N/C":null,"N/C Reason":"",latitude:38.734623,longitude:-85.375967,"Street Number":"217",Modifier:"","Street Direction":"",Street:"Walnut","Street Type":"Street",Notes:"",streetGeo:{latitude:38.73462749999999,longitude:-85.37570729999999}},{Address:"217 West 1st Street","Historic Name of Resource":"","Building Type":"House","Freestanding or Other":"Duplex",Style:"Federal",SubStyle:"None","Primary Style":"Federal",Approximate:"TRUE",Range:"FALSE",StartDate:1840,EndDate:1840,"NHL Rating":"C","#C":1,"#N/C":null,"N/C Reason":"",latitude:38.734589,longitude:-85.382152,"Street Number":"217",Modifier:"","Street Direction":"West",Street:"1st","Street Type":"Street",Notes:"",streetGeo:{latitude:38.734809,longitude:-85.38207640000002}},{Address:"217 West 2nd Street","Historic Name of Resource":"Robinson (Lanier - Schofield) House","Building Type":"House","Freestanding or Other":"",Style:"Federal",SubStyle:"None","Primary Style":"Federal",Approximate:"TRUE",Range:"FALSE",StartDate:1818,EndDate:1818,"NHL Rating":"C","#C":1,"#N/C":null,"N/C Reason":"",latitude:38.735416,longitude:-85.38199,"Street Number":"217",Modifier:"","Street Direction":"West",Street:"2nd","Street Type":"Street",Notes:"The Federal style house at 217 W.

Main Street was built from 1871-72 in the style of the Second Empire by architect John Temperly. Even though the foundation is not visible, the plan is rectangular with walls clad in brick common bond. Including the large attic floor created by the mansard roof, the building contains four stories, with inset entries on the ground floor. The front of the  building is ornamented with Corinthian columns and a segmental arch above the center entry. Large glass display windows are prominent with prism glass above. Windows are two over two lights with segmental arches. The Mansard roof on the Masonic Building has two slopes on all four sides, but the lower slope is much steeper. The roof is topped by standard slate shingles, interrupted by portions of multi-colored slate in a diamond pattern. Arched dormer windows are above a cornice of scrolled eave brackets, while at the center of the facade a gable rises with a half star crown. Much like other Second Empire buildings, the Masonic Building is completely symmetrical. Recorders of the Historic American Buildings Survey remarked: "Of special note on the facade of the building are the stone ball and water-leaf capitals of the small collumnettes that set off the storefronts of the first floor, which are beautiful examples of the talents of local stone cutters."',streetGeo:{latitude:38.736267,longitude:-85.37813499999999}},{Address:"219 Walnut

building at 227 E Main Street was constructed as early as 1830.  It is one of four buildings located on the Bierck-Heuse Block. Others are 223, 225 and 229 E Main Street.  Even though previous records state construction dates in the 1880s, there is interior  evidence that at least the building at number 227 was built in the 1830s. For example, the building seems to have been shorter, but  added on to at a later date. Not only that, the outline of the former roof on 227 can be seen from the third floor of 225. It was originally a low pitch side gable, which suggests an older date. In each, the first floor was originally one long narrow room used for retail business. The other buildings also appear to date earlier than the front facades. These buildings were remodeled ca. 1880 for Peter Bierck and Otto Reuse as a continuous block of four storefronts.  All four buildings were unified with new Italianate windows, facades, cornices and ground floor iron fronts.  The store front of 227 E.

Most of the buildings are three stories in height and retain their original facades. All are constructed of brick laid in a variant of the Flemish bond pattern. The building at 301, the Central Hotel, has a mitered corner opening with commercial glass windows. Above, its windows are replacements set in openings with Italianate segmental arch pressed metal hoods and stone sills. The building at No. 303 has similar modern windows set in flat pedimented Italianate crowns. Along the Second Street side of the Central Hotel, the windows are modern twelve/over/nine pane set in the original flat dressed stone lintel and sills. The side gabled rooflines of 301 and 303 are joined with an Italianate projecting front cornice that has decorative floral elements and scroll  cut brackets, this cornice continues around the side of 301.

Its roofline, like that at 307 and 309 to the north, is a simple band of brick corbelling and dentils at the cornice. No. 307 has openings with flat dressed stone lintels and sills and a modern street level door. The building at 309, however, features a cast iron front from a later nineteenth-century Italianate upgrade. This front has Corinthian columns flanking double upper light commercial glass doors. The windows above are six/over/six and four/over/four with dressed stone lintels and sills. The building at 311 has lost much of its original integrity in windows and doors, but retains the original openings on the second and third floors and remnants of an iron front. Its roofline has a projecting cornice with brackets. No. 313 is similar to other houses in the row, it has replacement windows in flat dressed stone lintels and sills and a simple cornice with brick corbelling and dentils.

Leaded and painted glass fills this window and the arch features a decorative exaggerated keystone. Two double story classically pedimented openings with multilight windows flank the central arch. Four pilasters with Ionic capitals separate the three bays. The roof is a low pitch front gable concealed by a parapetted front signage. This classic denticulated frieze parapet has a rising central area adorned with an Elk head statue. There are several brick chimneys along the side walls of the building.",streetGeo:{latitude:38.7371949,longitude:-85.38023579999998}},{Address:"421 1/2 Cragmont Street","Historic Name of

Type":"Street",Notes:"Architects W. Russell West and Mathew Temperly built the Christ Episcopal Church at 506 Mulberry Street in the Gothic Revival style. The church derives its character from the pointed arch doors and windows. The vertical panel entry door is set into a pointed arch brick surround with flanking buttresses. The windows along the nave are stained glass and set into pointed arch openings with stone sills and brick surrounds. A buttress is found between each of the windows along the side walls. The high pitch roof is also typical of the style,  and this one features a tower at the southwest corner with a conical roof and pointed arch vents and dormer windows. The tower also has a circular window and a cross at its finial. The foundation of the church is of coursed, dressed stone and the walls are laid in brick common bond pattern.

Architect Francis Costigan designed and built this house in 1843 for Madison financier James Lanier. The home has outstanding beauty and proportions, demonstrates successful adaptation of period architectural pattern books, and retains a high degree of integrity in preservation. The three-story mansion is cubic in form and sits upon a high foundation of coursed, square-cut dressed sandstone. Walls are of brick common bond, each side has three bays of windows separated by pilasters. The home presents a porch facade to both its northern First Street side and its southern Ohio River side. The north facade has a one-story flat roof portico with classic columns. The entry on this side is an inset full panel door with side transom lights and a classic surround. The southern facade has a grand full height and width porch. Simple Corinthian capitals top the four fluted columns that stretch two and a half stories tall. The ceiling of this porch features delicate beadwork and molded decoration. The entry doors on this southern side are similar to those on the north facade. Windows on north and south facades are six/over/nine on the ground floor; windows on the second floor and the sides are six/over/six panes. Windows on each facade directly above the central door are wider, divided into three sections by a column. All windows have wide Classic pediment surrounds with decorative rosettes. The roof of the home is not visible from the ground, as a tall fascia board rises to hide it. This board is decorated with Anthernion carvings at the center of each side, dentils, various molding details, and has round windows encircled by wreaths. A central cupola rises above the central stairwell to crown the building. There is a one-story kitchen addition to the east side with a mansard roof and pedimented windows. The interior features a cantilevered spiral staircase, double parlors, and unusual window shutters. The site also includes many iron fences, the gardens (described separately,) archeological excavation sites, and statuary.

Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Boston pioneered the movement early in the century and many others followed. Springdale is set in a small protected valley at the north side of Madison, with Crooked Creek as its southern boundary, and the base of the hill as its northern boundary. Today, State highway 7 has cut off the original entry, although the land and burials have remained intact. Entrance to the cemetery is now from the east and visitors travel down the main road from east to west, with secondary roads branching off in a rectilinear pattern.  The grounds are punctuated by several stone lined drainage ditches running in a north/south direction, probably dating from the middle of the nineteenth century. Sections of the cemetery are highlighted by tall sculpture and decorative markers, including a number of obelisks and other styles. Several family plots are located, European style, in terraces up the hill - some with rock faced stone retaining walls. There is a spectacular sculpture, "Let there be Light\'\', by the nationally known artist George Grey Barnard. Only a few buildings are included on the site. One, a gable front residence serves as an office and was probably incorporated into the cemetery during a period of expansion.  A second building is a Gothic Revival chapel constructed in 1916 and designed by the architect Frederick Wallick who designed a large number of important houses in Indianapolis, including "Oldfields" (for the Lilly family), "Lanesend" for Nicholas H. Noyes and "Westerley", the G. H. A. Clowes house, as well as the Polk Hotel, in Polk County, Florida, and the Joseph J. Cole house in Indianapolis.   The latter two are both listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Wallick\'s chapel in Springdale is constructed of dressed stone with imitation quoins, corner buttresses, stained glass windows and a gable front roof with crockets, and a raised parapet with dressed coping. One object, one building and the landscape (site) are contained within this property. The building at 600 Fifth Street is also within the cemetery. However, it has been listed individually.

It was dedicated to this purpose even before the addition in which it is located was platted. Later Springdale Cemetery to the north replaced this site as the city burying ground. There is a curvilinear walk along the upper part of the park with large trees, benches, a gazebo and other small scale features. The lower level is devoted primarily to sports, with a large playing field. The latter was made possible after Crooked Creek was relocated to the north during the nineteenth century. During the Victorian era, after the burials had been removed, a series of structures were built, including a round folly with a segmented, slightly bellcast, roof covered in slate shingles and sporting metal ridgeline caps and a decorative ball at  the spire (Photo No. 25). This small contributing building was constructed of a combination of petrified rock and rough cut local limestone.  A more spectacular feature was also built in the park - a round fountain of petrified rock, with a buttressed three foot base and a conical upper structure, of the same material. Today, only the base of this fountain remains in the park, but one can see the distinctive rocks used in several walls in other parts of the town, perhaps removed from the park when the fountain was dismantled. The vegetation includes several large trees, including a 48" caliper sycamore and others. The natural bowl formed by the topography is utilized now as in history as a viewing area for the sports activities.',streetGeo:{latitude:38.7376475,longitude:-85.38573309999998}},{Address:"Retaining Wall Mulberry Street","Historic Name of Resource":"","Building Type":"Retaining Wall","Freestanding or Other":"",Style:"Other",SubStyle:"None","Primary Style":"Other",Approximate:"TRUE",Range:"FALSE",StartDate:1890,EndDate:1890,"NHL Rating":"C","#C":1,"#N/C":null,"N/C Reason":"",latitude:38.739992,longitude:-85.378806,"Street Number":"",Modifier:"","Street Direction":"",Street:"Mulberry","Street Type":"Street",Notes:"",streetGeo:{latitude:38.7365752,longitude:-85.37877029999999}},{Address:"Riverfront Development East Vaughn Drive","Historic Name of Resource":"","Building Type":"Riverfront Development","Freestanding or Other":"",Style:"None",SubStyle:"None","Primary Style":"No Style",Approximate:"TRUE",Range:"FALSE",StartDate:1990,EndDate:1990,"NHL Rating":"N/C","#C":null,"#N/C":1,"N/C Reason":"NIP",latitude:38.733054,longitude:-85.382577,"Street Number":"",Modifier:"","Street Direction":"East",Street:"Vaughn","Street Type":"Drive",Notes:"",streetGeo:{latitude:38.7325152,longitude:-85.37185410000001}},{Address:"Spring Street Stone Culvert Sering Street","Historic Name of Resource":"Spring Street Stone Culvert","Building Type":"Culvert","Freestanding or Other":"",Style:"Functional",SubStyle:"19th Century","Primary Style":"Other: 19th C.

Hard limestone, or calcite, rough dressed, is laid on end to form the edge curbs, while slabs of the same stone are buried, perpendicular to the edge curbs, to form the center of the guttering. Other types, which may date later, utilize large, dressed stone as curbs only.
